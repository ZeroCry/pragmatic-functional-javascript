# Less is more

Having a lot of ways to do a job and to solve a problem in the same context is always good, right? Well, not always. If you pluck most programming languages that are largely used by the market, then you have a functional language ─ and this is valid also to JavaScript. JavaScript has strong ties with Scheme and has the perfect potential to be a very good functional language. Remove loops, mutability, references, conditional statements, exceptions, labels, blocks and you virtually have a dynamically typed OCaml dialect. I'm serious, you can even define functions in JavaScript without giving importance to the order they occur, just like OCaml em Haskell do ─ this is what we can call hoisting and we'll be seing how to take advantage of this in the next chapters.

Don't be miser. Do you really need all that different unaddressed language constructs? In the chapters of this book we'll discard a large part of JavaScript and we'll focus only in an expressive subset: functions and bindings, it is everything we'll need for now! Before learning functional programming with JavaScript, you first will have to think about unlearning some things. This is necessary to avoid language vices and to estimulate your brain to solve problems in a declarative way. For now, you'll have to trust, but in the course of this book you'll see how everything makes sense and fits into the purpose.
