# The second chance

> And God said, "let there be functions", and there were functions.

In the beginning, computers were very slow, way slower than running Android Studio on your 2GB RAM machine! When the first physical computers appeared and programming languages started to be designed and implemented, there were mainly 2 mindsets:

1. Start from the Von Neumann architecture and **add abstraction**;
2. Start from mathematics and **remove abstraction**.

When it all started, dealing with high levels of abstraction was very hard and costly, so imperative programming languages got a lot more visibility than functional ones.
