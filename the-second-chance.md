# The second chance

> And God said, "let there be functions", and there were functions.

In the beginning, computers were very slow, way slower than running Android Studio on your 2GB RAM machine! When the first physical computers appeared and programming languages started to be designed and implemented, there were mainly 2 mindsets:

1. Start from the Von Neumann architecture and **add abstraction**;
2. Start from mathematics and **remove abstraction**.

When it all started, dealing with high levels of abstraction was very hard and costly, memory and storage were really small in power, so imperative programming languages got a lot more visibility than functional ones because imperative languages had a lower level of abstraction that was way easier to implement and map directly to the hardware. It could not be the best way to design programs and express ideas, but at least it was the faster one to run.

But computers improved a lot, and functional programming finally got its deserved chance! Functional programming is not a new concept. I'm serious, it is really old and came directly from mathematics! The core concepts and the functional computational model came even before physical computers existed. It had its origins on lambda calculus, and it was initally only a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability.

A lot of modern programming languages support well functional programming. Even Java surrended to this and implemented lambda expressions and streams. Most of you program in languages that were created; I want to show you the one which was discovered.
